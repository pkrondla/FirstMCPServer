# FirstMCPServer

A C# implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for monkey data management and visualization. This project serves as a learning example for building MCP servers and integrating them with AI assistants like Claude.

## 🐒 What is this?

This MCP server provides tools for managing monkey population data, including data retrieval, management, and visualization capabilities. It demonstrates how to build a complete MCP server using C# and integrate it with Claude Desktop for interactive AI-powered data analysis.

## 🌟 Features

- **Monkey Data Management**: Create, retrieve, and manage monkey population data
- **Interactive Tools**: Multiple MCP tools for different monkey-related operations
- **Data Visualization**: Built-in graphing capabilities for population analysis
- **MCP Compliance**: Full adherence to Model Context Protocol standards
- **Claude Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude Desktop

## 🛠️ Project Structure

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [.NET 6.0 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop) (for testing MCP integration)
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET development

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pkrondla/FirstMCPServer.git
cd FirstMCPServer
```

### 2. Build the Project

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 3. Run the MCP Server

```bash
dotnet run
```

### 4. Configure Claude Desktop

Add the following configuration to your Claude Desktop MCP settings:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "mcp-monkey-server": {
            "command": "dotnet",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "--project",
                "C:\\FirstMCPServer\\FirstMCPServer.csproj",
                "--no-build"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## 🔧 Available Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools that can be used through Claude:

### `GetMonkeys`
Retrieves a list of all monkeys in the database.

### `GetMonkeyByName`
Gets detailed information about a specific monkey by name.
- **Parameters**: `name` (string) - The name of the monkey to retrieve

### `DrawMonkeyGraph`
Generates a bar graph visualization of monkey populations.

### `TestTool`
Tests if the MCP server is working correctly.

## 🎯 Usage Examples

Once integrated with Claude Desktop, you can interact with the server using natural language:

```
"Show me all the monkeys in the database"
"Get information about a monkey named 'Bobo'"
"Draw a graph of monkey populations"
"Test if the monkey server is working"
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **Program.cs**: Entry point that sets up the MCP server and handles protocol communication
- **MonkeyService.cs**: Business logic for monkey data operations
- **MonkeyTools.cs**: Utility functions for data processing and visualization

### MCP Integration

The server implements the Model Context Protocol by:
1. Exposing tools through the MCP interface
2. Handling tool calls from AI assistants
3. Returning structured responses in MCP format
4. Managing state and context across interactions

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing with Claude Desktop
1. Start the MCP server
2. Open Claude Desktop with the server configured
3. Try the example commands listed above

### Using MCP Tool Inspector

The MCP Tool Inspector is a powerful debugging and testing tool that allows you to interact with your MCP server directly without needing Claude Desktop.

#### Installation
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dotnet run --project path/to/FirstMCPServer
```

#### Alternative Installation
If you prefer to install globally:
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
mcp-inspector dotnet run --project path/to/FirstMCPServer
```

#### Using the Inspector
1. **Start the Inspector**: Run the command above to launch the web-based inspector
2. **Open Browser**: Navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`)
3. **Explore Tools**: The inspector will show all available tools from your MCP server
4. **Test Tools**: Click on any tool to see its schema and test it with different parameters
5. **View Responses**: See real-time responses and debug any issues

#### Inspector Benefits
- **Tool Discovery**: Automatically lists all available tools with their schemas
- **Interactive Testing**: Test tools with custom parameters without writing code
- **Response Inspection**: View detailed request/response data for debugging
- **Schema Validation**: Verify your tool schemas are correctly implemented
- **Development Workflow**: Rapid iteration and testing during development

#### Example Inspector Session
1. Launch inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dotnet run --project .`
2. Open the web interface
3. Click on `GetMonkeys` to see available monkeys
4. Test `GetMonkeyByName` with parameter `name: "Bobo"`
5. Try `DrawMonkeyGraph` to generate population visualization
6. Use `TestTool` to verify server connectivity

### Automated Testing
```bash
dotnet test
```
